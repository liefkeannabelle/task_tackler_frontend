# Assignment 4c: Final Implementation

With this final assignment, I have a complete implementation of the Task Tackler app. I captured the various design decisions, particularly the departures from original plans, in the [design document](/process_docs/design-document.md) included in this repository. Additionally, I submitted the final walkthrough that demonstrates the app's features and functionality with the [trace file](/process_docs/console-output.md) from recording the video.
