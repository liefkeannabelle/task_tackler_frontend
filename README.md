# Assignment 4b 
## Check In

I made note of the advice that Copilot gave me throughout in the [planning file](/process_docs/planning/checkin_planning.md). I documented a proposed [user journey](/process_docs/user_journeys/user_journey.md) (same as assignment 2). Finally, I have a [preliminary screenrecording](/process_docs/walkthroughs/checkinWalkthrough.mp4), though I'll admit it is in pretty rough shape right now. 

## Front End Complete

Since the checkin, I have flushed out both functionality and aesthetics of my app. Functionally, I captured the main changes in my [planning file](/process_docs/planning/full_frontend_planning.md). For aesthetic changes, I captured my vision in my [color study](/process_docs/visual_design_study/ColorStudy.jpg) and [font study](/process_docs/visual_design_study/TextStudy.jpg), though there are further aesthetic changes I hope to make. Finally, I have a working [walkthrough](/process_docs/walkthroughs/4c-walkthrough.mp4).
