# Completing the Personal Project: Design Document

## Operational Changes
- Currently shows all lists when no one is logged in
- Figure out how to not need reload to get statuses to update
    - Also shows previous user's list items before reload (probably would be fixed with same solution)

## Aesthetic Changes
- Swap sides of login and sections
- Make sections buttons
- Change fonts
