# Planning Frontend

Random note:
Backend = deno task concepts
Frontend = npm run dev

## Done: 
- Added authentication
- Fixed list display (include task name)
- Added tasks by dropdown 
- Made user's task bank visible
- Made lists only visible when you are the owner


## To do: 
### Today's focus:
- Fix deleteList
- Remove need to give username for delete task (prob same process as for add) 
- Remove task statuses on lists
### In coming days:
- Fix adding dependencies (button doesn't do anything on the frontend)
- Fix session interface
    - Make selecting list a dropdown
    - Make format and ordering type dropdowns
    - Remove checking of user ID
    - Get rid of "randomize order" button (redundant with ordering type selection)
- Rearrange structure
    - Swap [Lists, Task Bank, Sessions] with "Signed in as.."
    - Make page dedicated to editing a particular list
- Make pretty
