Backend = deno task concepts
Frontend = npm run dev

## Done: 
- Added authentication

- Added tasks by dropdown 
- Made user's task bank visible
- Made lists only visible when you are the owner
- Fixed deleteList
- Removed username prompt box on deleteTask
- Removed task statuses on lists
- Fixed dependencies on task bank page
- Enforce dependencies when making list ordering

## To do: 
### Today's focus:
- Reword dependencies page to make more intuitive
### In coming days:
- Fix session interface
    - Make selecting list a dropdown
    - Make format and ordering type dropdowns
    - Remove checking of user ID
    - Get rid of "randomize order" button (redundant with ordering type selection)
- Rearrange structure
    - Swap [Lists, Task Bank, Sessions] with "Signed in as.."
    - Make page dedicated to editing a particular list
- Make pretty
