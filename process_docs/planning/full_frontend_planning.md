# Planning Frontend

Changes to the skeleton:
- Make list format include the name of the tasks (and maybe description) and remove status aspect from tasks

- Change the user authentication process
Currently requires user to input their id with every new task, list, and session
Would like to be able to "login" at the beginning and go from there

- Make task bank visible on task screen
Would need to happen after authentication has been added, but would like to see the set of tasks that the user already has

- Need to completely rework the session start screen

Done: 
- Authentication
- Task bank visible
- Got deleteList working
- Make lists only visible when you are the owner


Right now: 
- Remove need to give username for delete (prob same process as for add)
- Remove task statuses on lists
